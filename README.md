VOCAB CLI
- Ruby version: `3.2.1`

This is a quick and easy way to note down new words and test your vocabulary!

There are 4 main choices for a user to select:

1) Add a new word: This allows a user to add in as many new words, and the definitions for those words, as they want
2) See all words: By choosing this option, a user can see all the words they have added so far
3) Quiz mode: This option mimics flashcards. A random word that the user has entered will be chosen and displayed. The user has the option to exit or continue on to see the definition and check if they got it right. They can stay in quiz mode for as long as they want.
4) Exit: This command allows the user to exit the CLI app
